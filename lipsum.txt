About Initializr
Initializr is here to kick-start the development of your new projects. It generates templates based 
on HTML5 Boilerplate by allowing you to choose which parts you want or don't want from it. 
A responsive template has also been added to start from a basic design instead of a blank page.

Here are some which will help you using Initializr and understanding HTML5 Boilerplate, HTML5shiv or Modernizr, 
in French, Italian, Russian, Dutch, Portuguese, Polish, and Japanese.
